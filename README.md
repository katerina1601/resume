# resume

Previously I had [my Resume](Resume.md) in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org).  But
since it's painful to do that on OS X (no normal package management and
manually installation is bad), and honestly I do not do
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org) beside Resume, I've decided to move to
GitHub.  I like it better.
